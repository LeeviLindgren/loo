\usage{
relative_eff(x, ...)

\method{relative_eff}{default}(x, chain_id, ...)

\method{relative_eff}{matrix}(x, chain_id, ...)

\method{relative_eff}{array}(x, ...)

\method{relative_eff}{function}(x, ..., data, draws)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector, matrix, or 3-D array. See the \strong{Methods (by class)}
section below for details on the shape of \code{x}. For use with the
\code{loo} function, the values in \code{x} should be likelihood values
(i.e., \code{exp(log_lik)}). For generic \code{use} with
\code{\link{psis}}, the values in \code{x} should be the reciprocal of the
importance ratios (i.e., \code{exp(-log_ratios)}).}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to the methods.}

\item{chain_id}{A vector of length \code{NROW(x)} containing MCMC chain
indexes for each each row of \code{x} (if a matrix) or each value in
\code{x} (if a vector). No \code{chain_id} is needed if \code{x} is a 3-D
array. If there are \code{C} chains then valid chain indexes are values
in \code{1:C}.}
}
\value{
A scalar if \code{x} is a vector, or a vector if \code{x} is a matrix
  or 3-D array.
}
\description{
\code{relative_eff} computes the the MCMC effective sample size divided by
the total sample size. The matrix and array methods perform the computations
independently for each observation.

\section{Methods (by class)}{
\itemize{
\item \code{default}: A vector of length \eqn{S} (posterior sample size).

\item \code{matrix}: An \eqn{S} by \eqn{N} matrix, where \eqn{S} is the size
of the posterior sample (with all chains merged) and \eqn{N} is the number
of data points.

\item \code{array}: An \eqn{I} by \eqn{C} by \eqn{N} array, where \eqn{I}
is the number of MCMC iterations per chain, \eqn{C} is the number of
chains, and \eqn{N} is the number of data points.

\item \code{function}: An \eqn{I} by \eqn{C} by \eqn{N} array, where \eqn{I}
is the number of MCMC iterations per chain, \eqn{C} is the number of
chains, and \eqn{N} is the number of data points.
