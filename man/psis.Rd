\usage{
psis(x, ...)

\method{psis}{array}(x, ..., cores = getOption("loo.cores", 1),
  wtrunc = TRUE)

\method{psis}{matrix}(x, chain_id, ..., cores = getOption("loo.cores", 1),
  wtrunc = TRUE)

\method{psis}{default}(x, chain_id, ..., wtrunc = TRUE)

\method{weights}{psis}(object, ..., log = TRUE, normalize = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An array, matrix, or vector of log-weights (for LOO these are
negative log-likelihood values). See the \strong{Methods (by class)}
section below for a detailed description of how to specify the inputs for
each method.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed on to the various methods.}

\item{cores}{The number of cores to use for parallelization. The default for
an entire R session can be set with \code{options(loo.cores = NUMBER)}. As
of version \code{2.0.0} the \strong{default is now 1 core}, but we
recommend using as many (or close to as many) cores as possible.}

\item{wtrunc}{Should weights be truncated? Set to \code{FALSE} or \code{0}
no truncation. As of version \code{2.0.0}, the default is to truncate
the smoothed weights at the (column) maximum(s) of the raw weights.}

\item{chain_id}{A vector of length \code{NROW(x)} containing MCMC chain
indexes for each each row of \code{x} (if a matrix) or each value in
\code{x} (if a vector). No \code{chain_id} is needed if \code{x} is a 3-D
array. If there are \code{C} chains then valid chain indexes are values
in \code{1:C}.}

\item{object}{For the \code{weights} method, an object returned by
\code{psis} (a list with class \code{"psis"}).}

\item{log}{For the \code{weights} method, should the weights be returned on
the log scale? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{normalize}{For the \code{weights} method, should the weights be
normalized? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
The \code{psis} methods return an object of class \code{"psis"},
  which is a named list with the following components:

\describe{
  \item{\code{log_weights}}{
    Vector or matrix of smoothed but \emph{unnormalized} log weights. To get
    normalized weights use the \code{weights} method provided for objects
    of class \code{"psis"}.
  }
  \item{\code{pareto_k}}{
    Vector of estimated \link[=pareto-k-diagnostic]{shape parameter(s) k} of
    the generalized Pareto distribution.
  }
  \item{\code{n_eff}}{
    Vector of estimated PSIS effective sample size(s).
  }
}

Objects of class \code{"psis"} also have the following
\code{\link{attributes}}:
\describe{
  \item{\code{norm_const_log}}{
    Vector of precomputed values of \code{colLogSumExps(log_weights)} that are
    used internally by the \code{weights} method to normalize the log weights.
  }
  \item{\code{tail_len}}{
    Vector of tail lengths used for fitting the generalized Pareto
    distribution.
  }
  \item{\code{rel_n_eff}}{
    Vector of relative effective sample size estimates of the exponentiated
    log-likelihood.
  }
  \item{\code{dims}}{
    Integer vector of length 2 containing \code{S} (posterior sample size)
    and \code{N} (number of observations).
  }
}

The \code{weights} method returns an object with the same dimensions
  as the \code{log_weights} component of the \code{"psis"} object. The
  \code{normalize} and \code{log} arguments control whether the returned
  weights are normalized and whether or not to return them on the log scale.

\description{
Implementation of Pareto smoothed importance sampling, a method for
stabilizing importance weights. For full details about the algorithm see
Vehtari, Gelman and Gabry (2017a, 2017b). For diagnostics see the
\link{pareto-k-diagnostic} page.

\section{Methods (by class)}{
\itemize{
\item \code{array}: An \eqn{I} by \eqn{C} by \eqn{N} array, where \eqn{I}
is the number of MCMC iterations per chain, \eqn{C} is the number of
chains, and \eqn{N} is the number of data points. For example, the object
returned by \code{\link{extract_log_lik}(stanfit, merge_chains = FALSE)}.

\item \code{matrix}: An \eqn{S} by \eqn{N} matrix, where \eqn{S} is the size
of the posterior sample (with all chains merged) and \eqn{N} is the number
of data points. For example, the object returned by
\code{\link{extract_log_lik}(stanfit, merge_chains = TRUE)}.

\item \code{default}: A vector of length \eqn{S} (posterior sample size).
