\title{LOO weighting using Bayesian bootstrap samples adjustment}
\usage{
loo_weight(lpd_point, BB_n = 1000, alpha = 1, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{lpd_point}{A matrix of pointwise leave-one-out likelihood evaluated in different models. Each column corresponds to one model.}

\item{BB_n}{A positivs integer indicating the number of samples in Bayesian Bootstrap. Default is 1000.}

\item{alpha}{A postive scaler; the shape paramter in the Dirichlet distribution when doing Bayesian Bootstrap.}

\item{seed}{An integer; optional. If specified, it fixes the random seed when dong Bayesian Bootstrap.}
}
\value{
A vector of LOO weights.
}
\description{
LOO weighting using Bayesian bootstrap samples adjustment
}
\details{
\code{lpd_point} is a matrix of pointwise leave-one-out likelihood, which can be calculeted from  \code{\link{loo}}. It should be a \eqn{N} by \eqn{K}  matrix when Sample size is \eqn{N} and model number is \eqn{K}.   Bayesian bootstrap  takes into account the uncertainty of finite data points and regularize the weights making them go further away from 0 and 1. The shape parameter in the Dirichlet distribution is \code{alpha}. When \code{alpha}=1, the distribution is uniform on the simplex space. A smaller {alpha} will keeps the final weights more away from 0 and 1.
