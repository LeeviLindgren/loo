\title{Stacking of predictive distributions}
\usage{
stacking_weight(lpd_point, optim_method = "BFGS")
}
\arguments{
\item{lpd_point}{A  matrix of pointwise leave-one-out likelihood evaluated in
different models. Each column corresponds to one model.}

\item{optim_method}{The optimization method to be used in stacking; it can
be chosen from "Nelder-Mead", "BFGS", "CG", "L-BFGS-B", "SANN" and "Brent".
The default one is "BFGS".}
}
\value{
A vector of best model weights that maximize the leave-one-out log
  score of the combination.
}
\description{
Stacking of predictive distributions
}
\details{
\code{lpd_point} is a matrix of pointwise log leave-one-out
  likelihood, which can be calculated from \code{\link{loo}} or through
  running exact LOO in advance. It should be a \eqn{N} by \eqn{K}  matrix
  when Sample size is \eqn{N} and model number is \eqn{K}. \code{stacking} is
  an approach that finds the optimal linear combining weight which maximizes
  the leave-one-out log score.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
loo1 <- loo(log_lik1)$pointwise[,1]
loo2 <- loo(log_lik2)$pointwise[,1]
stacking_weight(cbind(loo1, loo2))
}

\item \code{\link{optim}} for the choice of optimization methods.
