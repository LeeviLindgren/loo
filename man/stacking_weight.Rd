\title{stacking on log score}
\usage{
stacking_weight(lpd_point)
}
\arguments{
\item{lpd_point}{A  matrix of pointwise leave-one-out likelihood evaluated in different models. Each column corresponds to one model.}
}
\value{
A vector of best weights that minimize the levae-one-out log score.
}
\description{
stacking on log score
}
\details{
\code{lpd_point} is a matrix of pointwise log leave-one-out likelihood, which can be calculeted from  \code{\link{loo}}. It should be a \eqn{N} by \eqn{K}  matrix when Sample size is \eqn{N} and model number is \eqn{K}. \code{stacking} is an approach that finds the optimal linear combining weight so as to minimize the leave-one-out log score.

\examples{
\dontrun{
loo1 <- loo(log_lik1)$pointwise[,1]
loo2 <- loo(log_lik2)$pointwise[,1]
stacking_weight(cbind(loo1, loo2))
}
}

\code{\link{loo}} for details on leave-one-out elpd estimation.
\code{\link{bb-weight}} for model weighting by Leave-one-out and Bayesian bootstrap adjustment.
