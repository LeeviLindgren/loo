\title{Generic (expected) log-predictive density}
\usage{
elpd(x, ...)

\method{elpd}{array}(x, ...)

\method{elpd}{matrix}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A log-likelihood array, matrix, or function. The \strong{Methods (by class)}
section, below, has detailed descriptions of how to specify the inputs for
each method.}

\item{...}{For the \code{loo.function()} method and the \code{loo_i()}
function, these are the data, posterior draws, and other arguments to pass
to the log-likelihood function. See the \strong{Methods (by class)} section
below for details on how to specify these arguments.}
}
\description{
The \code{elpd()} methods for arrays, and matrices can compute the expected log pointwise predictive density for a new dataset or the log pointwise predictive density of the observed data (an overestimate of the elpd).
}
\details{
The \code{elpd()} function is an S3 generic and methods are provided for
3-D pointwise log-likelihood arrays, pointwise log-likelihood matrices.

\section{Methods (by class)}{
\itemize{
\item \code{array}: An \eqn{I} by \eqn{C} by \eqn{N} array, where \eqn{I}
is the number of MCMC iterations per chain, \eqn{C} is the number of
chains, and \eqn{N} is the number of data points.

\item \code{matrix}: An \eqn{S} by \eqn{N} matrix, where \eqn{S} is the size
of the posterior sample (with all chains merged) and \eqn{N} is the number
of data points.
