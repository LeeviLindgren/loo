\title{The observations indecies in the original data}
\usage{
obs_idx(x, rep = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{psis_loo_ss} object.}

\item{rep}{should multiple samples of same observations be returned?}
}
\value{
an integer lector of length \code{nobs}.
}
\description{
The observations indecies in the original data
}
\details{
Returns a vector of the same length as the number of observations
(if \code{rep = TRUE})
If sampling with replacement is used, an observation can have multiples
samples, these are then repeated (ie a vector c(1,1,2) indicate that
observation 1 has been ssubampled two times.
If \code{rep = FALSE} only the unique indecies are returned.
