#' @describeIn <%= fn %> An \eqn{I} by \eqn{C} by \eqn{N} array, where \eqn{I}
#'   is the number of MCMC iterations per chain, \eqn{C} is the number of
#'   chains, and \eqn{N} is the number of data points. For example, the object
#'   returned by \code{\link{extract_log_lik}(stanfit, merge_chains = FALSE)}.
